## TASK THREE - Adding even numbers
# For Loop with Range
# for number in range(1, 11, 3):
#   print(number)
# prints numbers from 1 to 11 in 3 steps, i.e, 1, 4, 7, 10
#
# My Attempt
#

# # üö® Do not change the code above ‚òùÔ∏è
#
# # Write your code here üëá

# My Attempt 1
#
# Write your code here üëá
# for n in range(100):
#   if n == 0:
#     print(n)

# Write your code here üëá
# target = 100

# TASK SIX - Paswword Generator
#
# Hard level
#
# First attempt
# password = []
# for letters in nr_letters:
#   password.push(random.choice(letters))
#   for symbol in nr_symbols:
#     password.push(random.choice(symbols))
#     for numbers in nr_numbers:
#       password.push(random.choice(numbers))
#
# print(password.join)
#
# Didn't work...
#
# Second Attempt
# password = ""
#
# for char in range(1, nr_letters + 1):
#   password += random.choice(letters)
#   for sym in range(1, nr_symbols + 1):
#       password += random.choice(symbols)
#       for num in range(1, nr_numbers + 1):
#         password += random.choice(numbers)
#
# cryptic_password = random.shuffle(password)
#
# print("Password before scrambling:", password)
# print("Password after scrambled egg:", cryptic_password)
#
# Doesn't work with cryptic, when removing and just leaving line 160 it seems to print a pointer?
# Due to indenting???
#
# Watched solution but will re-try tomorrow...
#
# Third Attempt
#
# password = []
#
# for char in range(1, nr_letters + 1):
#     password.append(random.choice(letters))
# for char in range(1, nr_symbols + 1):
#     password.append(random.choice(symbols))
# for char in range(1, nr_numbers + 1):
#     password.append(random.choice(numbers))
#
# print(password)
# random.shuffle(password)
# print(password)
# cryptic = ''.join(password)
# print(cryptic)
#
# can't leave the parentheses blank for methods, i.e. password.join()
#
# can also same as join, by creating an empty string, using for loop to add chars to it
